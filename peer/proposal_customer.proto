// A Proposal is sent to an endorser for endorsement.  The proposal contains:
// 1. A header which should be unmarshaled to a Header message.  Note that
//    Header is both the header of a Proposal and of a Transaction, in that i)
//    both headers should be unmarshaled to this message; and ii) it is used to
//    compute cryptographic hashes and signatures.  The header has fields common
//    to all proposals/transactions.  In addition it has a type field for
//    additional customization. An example of this is the ChaincodeHeaderExtension
//    message used to extend the Header for type CHAINCODE.
// 2. A payload whose type depends on the header's type field.
// 3. An extension whose type depends on the header's type field.
//
// Let us see an example. For type CHAINCODE (see the Header message),
// we have the following:
// 1. The header is a Header message whose extensions field is a
//    ChaincodeHeaderExtension message.
// 2. The payload is a ChaincodeProposalPayload message.
// 3. The extension is a ChaincodeAction that might be used to ask the
//    endorsers to endorse a specific ChaincodeAction, thus emulating the
//    submitting peer model.
